*Small discoveries require big sacrifices.*

Hadrons, such as protons and neutrons, are particles that are made of quarks.

Until 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was a soup of small particles, like electrons, photons, and quarks. After that, it cooled enough to create hadrons.

The LHC collides beams of photons together to make smaller particles, such as different types of quarks. It essentially replicates the state of the universe one-millionth second after the Big Bang.

It is 27 kilometers in length and the biggest machine ever created.

The LHC has discovered many new particles, including the Higgs boson.

The Higgs boson is a particle that existed during the Big Bang. It creates a field that assigns mass to all matter throughout the universe.

The Future Circular Collider (FCC) will begin construction in 2030 and first experiments will start in 2040. It will be 100 kilometers long.
