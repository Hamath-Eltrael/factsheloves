At 2.5 million light-years away, Andromeda is the farthest object in the sky that the human eye can see. It it expected to collide with the Milky Way in five billion years.

Dwarf galaxies are small hard-to-detect galaxies that outnumber normal-sized galaxies by ten to one. Normal galaxies contain around 100 billion stars whereas dwarf galaxies only consist of a few million stars.

Dwarf galaxies tend to orbit their bigger counterparts.
