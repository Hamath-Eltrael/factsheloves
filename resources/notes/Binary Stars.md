The [[James Webb Space Telescope]] has given the best view yet of a unique phenomenon.

In the image, concentric rings of light radiate out from a pair of binary stars in the WR 140 system, 5600 light-years away.

These stars are regularly erupting expanding shells on carbon dust into space as their oval orbits draw them close together. Their stellar winds create rippling shocks as they collide.

Perhaps up to 85% of stars are in binary systems, whereas some are a collection of multiple stars.

	These protostars (early stars) are born out of rotating clouds of dust and gas, which act as nurseries for star formation. Rare clusters of multiple protostars remain unstable and mature into multi-star systems. The unstable ones will eject stars until they achieve stability and end up as single or binary stars.

The Sun was probably a binary star at some point in the solar system's formation and the other stars were ejected away.
