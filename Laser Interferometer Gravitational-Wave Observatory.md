Two black holes collided with one another 1.3 billion years ago. The collision created waves in the literal fabric of space-time. They had 50x more energy than everything else in the universe combined.

In 1916, Einstein proposed that a high-energy incident like the collision of two black holes would create such waves. He called them "gravitational waves."

One hundred years later, the waves traveling
