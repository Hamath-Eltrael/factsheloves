2 black holes collided with one another 1.3 billion years ago. The collision created waves in the literal fabric of space-time. They had 50x more energy than everything else in the universe combined.

In 1916, Einstein proposed that a high-energy incident like the collision of two black holes would create such waves. He called them "gravitational waves."

100 years later, the waves traveling from those two black holes reached Earth. It literally stretched and compressed space-time, and Earth with it, by less than an atom's diameter. This distortion was detected by LIGO, confirming the existence of gravitational waves.

LIGO consists of 2 facilities that have 4 kilometer-long lasers hitting one another. The movement of the gravitational wave changed the length of these lasers by 1/1000th the width of a proton.
