During the industrial revolution, 40 thousand works died annual in factories alone. They included immigrants from across the world who worked highly dangerous minimum wage jobs.

*"What the hell are we going to do without men? You look around this city here and you see all these buildings go up. These men that are doing impossible things. They're under the streets working on the sewers, they're up on the power lines in the storms and the rain. They're keeping this impossible infrastructure functioning. This thing that works in a miraculous manner. They work themselves to death, and often literally." — Jordan Peterson*
