Contrary to common belief, the universe does not consist of galaxies and empty space.

There is more matter in intergalactic space that within the galaxies.

These parts of space are occupied by runaway stars, isolated supernovas, X-ray-emitting gas, hydrogen clouds, cosmic rays, and vacuum energy.

The Carina Nebula and the Pillars of Creation are both examples of star-forming factories in the Milky Way.

In galaxy clusters, the mass of gas between the galaxies is 10x more than the mass of objects within the galaxies.
