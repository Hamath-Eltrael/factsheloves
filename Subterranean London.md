[[HUMANS.canvas|HUMANS]]

Subterranean London refers to a number of structures that lire beneath London. The city has been occupied by humans for over two millennia. Over time, the city has acquired a vast number of these structures and spaces, often as a result of ware and conflict.

These include abandoned places where the public is not allowed. Some areas are dozens of stories below the surface and go as far as 67 to 80 meters deep.
