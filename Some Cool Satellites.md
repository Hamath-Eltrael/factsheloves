Starlink is a satellite constellation that aims to provide free internet access across the globe. The satellites communicate with each other through lasers.

Since they are in a low orbit at 550km, they are visible in the sky.

Dove satellites were invented by a garage startup. Each satellite only weighs 4kg and provides high-definition geological imagery.

The constellation orbits the Earth in a line and takes pictures as the plant rotates.

This technology can allow us to observe real-time changes at all locations every 24 hours, such as urbanism, deforestation, natural disasters, and melting glaciers.

The data will be made public for everyone, including nonprofit and non-government organizations.
