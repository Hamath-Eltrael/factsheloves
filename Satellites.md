Starlink is a satellite constellation that aims to provide free internet access across the globe. The satellites communicate with each other through lasers.



Since they are in a low orbit at 550km, they are visible in the sky.

Dove satellites were invented by a garage startup. Each satellite only weighs 4kg and provides high-definition geological imagery.

The constellation orbits the Earth in a line and takes pictures as the plant rotates.

This technology can allow us to observe real-time changes at all locations every 24 hours, such as urbanism, deforestation, natural disasters, and melting glaciers.

The data will be made public for everyone, including nonprofit and non-government organizations.

Below are examples of the satellite imagery.

Many countries use theÂ Indian Space Research Organisation to launch their satellites as it is the most cost-efficient space agency in the world. It's budget is 1/10th of NASA's.

In 2017, it launched record 104 satellites into orbit for 10 countries in a single flight. This included 88 Dove satellites.
