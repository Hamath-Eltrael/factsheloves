*Small discoveries require big sacrifices.

Neutrinos are particles that have no charge and are 1 million times smaller than the electron. They travel at 99.99% the speed of light. 100 billion neutrinos emitted by the Sun pass through your thumbnail every second.

So how do you detect a particle that has no charge, is almost massless, and does not interact with matter? Scientists do so using huge underground tanks called neutrino detectors.

One such detector is the Super-Kamiokande in Japan. The facility is bigger than the statue of liberty and 1000 meters underground. It is used to detect neutrinos emitted by distant supernovas.

Out of 3 million billion neutrinos passing every square meter every second, SK only records 4000 of them each year.
